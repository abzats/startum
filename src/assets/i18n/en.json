In Denmark, I have been teaching for 13 years at a Saturday school for Russian-speaking bilingual children. I worked for 12 years at a school affiliated with the Russian Center for Science and Culture in Copenhagen, and since 2023, I have opened the STARTUM club-school with a group of like-minded individuals, where I work as an administrator. <br />We educate children on language and culture, creating a language environment for communication and organizing social events. <br />For the past 3 years, I have been preparing students from Birker√∏d Gymnasie for Russian literature exams at IB1 and IB2 levels with excellent results",

I'm an artist, illustrator, and graphic designer. <br />I graduated from the Moscow Stroganov State University of Arts and Industry with additional education in illustration and graphic design. I have been working as a graphic designer for over 5 years, and I also teach workshops on drawing and painting. Since 2024, I have been working at the Startum school. <br />In my classes, children learn to draw, get acquainted with artists, and study various techniques. Drawing develops fine motor skills, attention, creativity, and helps to manage emotions.",
